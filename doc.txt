:ARRAY IMPLEMENTATION:
1-D array => (Vector) => Signal
2-D array => (Matrix) => GrayScale Image
3-D array => (Tensor) => RGB Image

:COLOR SPACE:
Different type of color system [ RGB, Gray, BlackAndWhite]

:LEVELS:
Black and White => 2 levels [0, 1] => 1Bit
Gray Scale => 2^8 = 256 levels [0, 255] => 8Bits
RGB => Three Gray Scale Image with Intesity of each (Red, Green, Blue)
       3 Gray scale with Intesity (RGB) and each 256 levels

:PIXEL:
Eg(HD) => Resolution 1920x1080 and Type = RGB
BitDepth = 3
Size of Image(Bytes) = Resolution x BitDepth
